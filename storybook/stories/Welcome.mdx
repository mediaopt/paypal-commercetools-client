# Get Started

In order to start you need a running API hub. You can use your own API hub or [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) as a test environment.

The storybook stories have been integrated with [paypal-commercetools-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-commercetools-client) components and in the official documentation of this package you can see the general properties and specific properties based on each component. In these stories, we have the same structure as shown there. So it would be great to read the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-commercetools-client) of this package before continuing with the storybook stories.

## Payment Methods

Some payment methods are not enabled by default. If you are working with your API hub, you need to enable them in your PayPal dashboard. Some methods are also country-sensitive, for example [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) does not demonstrate american payment methods, namely Venmo.

## General Properties

These properties will be shown on all components and you can read more about them on the [paypal-commercetools-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-commercetools-client) documentation.

## sessionKey and sessionValue

You can use the default sessionKey and sessionValue that are already in the stories for testing from [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/). However, if you see the error for creating the payment you need to take a new token from [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/). If you are using your own API Hub you need to enter the sessionKey and sessionValue based on your structure and then we send them in the header for authorization.

### Getting a new token value

In order to get a new token from our API Hub you need to go to [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) and then add a product to the cart and on the network tab of the browser console copy the token and paste it in the storybook.
