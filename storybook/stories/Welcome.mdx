# Introduction

In here we show the payment methods available in the [PayPal commercetools API client npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-commercetools-client). The explanation how to use the client app and get payment methods to work is provided in the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-commercetools-client) of the package.

# Get Started

In order to start you need a running API hub. You can use your own API hub or [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) as a test environment.

In this stories we follow the structure of general and specific properties based on each component as in official documentation. So it would be great to read the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-commercetools-client) of this package before continuing with the storybook stories.

## Payment Methods

Some payment methods are not enabled by default. If you are working with your API hub, you need to enable them in your PayPal dashboard. Some methods are also country-sensitive or amount-sensitive. For example [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) does not demonstrate american payment methods, namely Venmo, and does not provide payment upon invoice below 5 Euro, [as requested by the payment provider Ratepay](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/apm/pay-upon-invoice/).

## General Properties

These properties will be shown on all components and you can read more about them on the [paypal-commercetools-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paypal-commercetools-client) documentation.

# Using [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) as a test environment

In order to use [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) as a test environment you need to get a token from the API Hub. Go to the [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/) and add any product to the cart. On the network tab of the browser console copy the token (frontastic-session) and requested-commercetools-frontend-extension-version and paste it in the storybook.

At the [poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site](https://poc-mediaopt2.frontend.site/):

In storybook:

# Using your own API Hub

If you are using your own API Hub you need to enter the sessionKey and sessionValue based on your structure and then we send them in the header for authorization.
